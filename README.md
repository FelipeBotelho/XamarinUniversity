# Welcome to Xamarin University!

We're excited to have you enrolled. Please read through this page, as it has lots of important things to be aware of.

## Software and Hardware Requirements

All the classes and labs of Xamarin University are based on the Xamarin version available in the Alpha Channel, since the iOS portion uses the fantastic Xamarin iOS Designer. You can do all the class labs using either your own installs, or you can use the Virtual Machines provided below. If you want to use your own install, see the [guide on changing your update channel](http://docs.xamarin.com/recipes/cross-platform/ide/change_updates_channel/).

### Mac Running OSX

If you're doing the iOS or Cross-platform portion of the course, you must have an Apple Computer running Mac OSX. This is both a legal and technical requirement. Apple requires that iOS Developers do their development on a Mac, and Xamarin uses the Xcode build chain to create native iOS packages.

### Xamarin Business Tier

Additionally, Xamarin University has a number of Enterprise focused classes that require at least the Business tier of Xamarin products. For the Fundamentals Course, Indie level is sufficient for everything except for development in Visual Studio and the WCF portion of the Intro to Web Services Class. If you're not subscribed to the Business tier, you can start a trial by following the instructions [here](http://docs.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/getting_started/beginning_a_xamarin_trial/)

### Virtual Machines

For performance and productivity reasons, we recommend doing the Xamarin University classes on your own machine/install, however, if you'd like to use a VM, for instance, if you want to stay on the Stable channel in your primary development environment, we've created two Virtual Machine images that have Xamarin all installed and ready to go. You can download them from the following links:

`mark to add links`

 * [Windows 8 VMWare Image](tbd) - This image requires the free VMWare Player that can be downloaded from from [here](tbd).
 * [Mac OSX](tbd) - This image requires the free Virtual Box software to run, which can be downloaded from [here](tbd).

# Install Check-in

Due to the interactive nature of the Xamarin University classes, you will not be allowed to participate in a class if you don't have your development environment setup and configured correctly. 

[send screenshots to <training@xamarin.com>]

 * [send screenshot of Xamarin Studio and/or Visual Studio update page showing alpha channel]
 * [download taskypro deploy to emulator (in android) simulator (in iOS), take a screen shot of it running]

[if you have any issue with installation, let us know at <training@xamarin.com> and we'll setup a session with a trainer to get it resolved]
